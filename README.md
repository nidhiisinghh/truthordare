## 📌 Project Description  
This project is a **fully on-chain Truth or Dare generator** built on Flare Network.  
Users can submit truths and dares directly to the smart contract, while anyone can request randomized selections for gameplay. This creates a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof version of the classic party game — powered entirely by blockchain.

---

## 🔥 Features  
- Add new **Truth** questions to the blockchain  
- Add new **Dare** challenges on-chain  
- Retrieve a **randomly generated truth**  
- Retrieve a **randomly generated dare**  
- On-chain data storage — permanent, censorship-resistant  
- Wallet-gated UI interaction  
- Automatic refresh after transactions  
- Real-time loading + confirmation status feedback

## 🧠 How It Solves the Problem  
Traditional truth-or-dare lists are centralized, repetitive, and editable only by one user.  
This dApp allows *anyone* to contribute and expand the dataset, while randomness ensures fairness and unpredictability.

### Use Cases  
| Scenario | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Friends playing socially | No repeated prompts, random selection adds excitement |
| Online streaming/party games | Audience participation through on-chain submissions |
| Expanding content library | Community-driven growth of truth/dare prompts |
| Immutable history | No one can alter or remove previously added items |

Users gain a trustless, collaborative, decentralized experience — turning a classic game into a shared blockchain-powered activity.

Enjoy the chain-powered chaos. 🎉  
Truth or Dare just became unstoppable.
